              <p>Black Girl TRIBE, Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to the <b><em>betterment of Black girls</em></b>. It provides culturally-competent and holistically focused programming centered around advocacy, 
                  mentorship, sexual health and sisterhood between Black girls and women of all ages.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-0"> Challenge</h5>
            <p>The purpose of the TRIBE website redesign was to encourage potential donors to 
                financially support the organization’s purpose, mission and programming. 
                During an heuristics evaluation, we observed that the website in its current state lacks an intuitive user flow ---specifically 
                regarding ways to join and contribute to TRIBE’s causes. Based on our findings, as-is, donors are 
                less likely to discover the full-scope of the organization’s work and make a financial commitment.</p>

                   <h5 class="mt-0"> Solution</h5>    
                   <p>To simplify and streamline the navigation process, accentuate contribution methods and highlight the organization’s impact within the community. 
                       We anticipated that these changes would help guide and inform users as they navigate the site and assist TRIBE in building robust relationships with the broader community.</p>

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <br>
      <div class="research">
      <h5>Query</h5>
      <p>How do we best redesign the site to increase awareness of TRIBE’s programming, 
        thereby increasing participation and funding?</p><br> 
      </div>

      <div class="Objectives"> 
      <h6>Objective 1: Engagement</h6><br>
        <h6><em>Amplyfying TRIBE's digital presence</em></h6><br>
        <p>Learn how engaged people are with charitable organizations and nonprofits within their community.</p>

        <p>Discover users motivations for charitable involvement and the kind of organizations they support.</p>
        <br>
        <h6>Objective 2: Donations</h6><br>
        <h6><em>Tapping into the donor's mindset</em></h6><br>
        <p>Gauge how much (monetarily) people are generally comfortable with donating 
          to causes of their choice and what prompts them to do so.</p> 

          <p>Gather the key decision-making factors that determine where users donate and how much.</p>

          <h3>Initial Key Insights</h3>
          <br>
          <h6>Stakeholder Interview</h6>
          <br>
          <p>The stakeholder noted that a full understanding of the organization’s culture and mission is vital.  
            Additionally, it was noted that people who visit the website are typically 
            looking for information about the annual Formation Conference and SIHLE programming. 
            Most engagement is done through social media (e.g. Facebook and IG) and
            users typically visit the site for information about upcoming events.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Donor Survey & Interview</h6>
            <p>From our donation survey we discovered the following key findings: users are likely to donate to organizations 
              that are (1) transparent about the use of funds, 
              (2) display a sincerity of intent, (3) have clear messaging about their mission and purpose, 
              and (4) have quick and highly visible avenues for donations.</p>
